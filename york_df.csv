ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FUNDAMENTALS,"This course introduces students to the field of artificial intelligence, with a focus on AI- driven business applications. It provides a historical perspective tracing the emergence of basic concepts of contemporary AI.  Students learn key artificial intelligence techniques including knowledge representation and symbolic reasoning, biologically  inspired approaches to AI, supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems and natural language processing."
DATABASE FUNDAMENTALS,"Database Management Systems are computer-based systems used by organizations to manage the vast amount of data that accompany daily operations, support data analysis, and enable intelligent decision making. This course provides an applied introduction to database management systems and their use in the business environment. The course covers the fundamentals of database analysis and design."
ALGORITHMS FOR BUSINESS ANALYSIS,"The course covers main approaches to design and analysis of algorithms used in business contexts, including important algorithms and data structures, and results in complexity and computability."
CASE ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION SKILLS,This course is designed to give students the opportunity to practice and develop their analytical thinking and presentation skills. The key objective of the course is to train students to successfully participate in national and international case competitions. A secondary objective is to prepare students to successfully interview for management consulting positions. Second-year MBA students who enjoy analyzing cases and delivering presentations are encouraged to take the course.
ETHICS AND SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,"This course is intended for students with professional interest in the social and ethical implications of AI. Topics include theoretical issues (could AI ever have moral rights?), practical issues (algorithmic bias, labour automation, data privacy), and professional issues (tech industry social responsibility)."
BUSINESS APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE I,"The emphasis in this course will be on automation and autonomous cyber-physical system applications of artificial intelligence. Students will delve deeper into topics which include: probabilistic reasoning & handling uncertainty; search; perception & sensing; human- computer interfacing; conversational systems; and autonomous robotics, drones, and autonomous vehicles."
VISUAL ANALYTICS AND MODELLING,"This course is an introduction to the fundamental theories of visual communication design applied in data visualization and visual analytics. Students become familiar with data-driven decision making workflows and storytelling best practices. Major areas for discussion include visual design principals, data structures, taxonomy of data visualization models and weekly technical tutorials using the Tableau software."
NUMERICAL METHODS AND ANALYSIS,"Numerical analysis is concerned with finding numerical solutions to problems for which analytical solutions either do not exist or are not readily or cheaply obtainable. This course provides an introduction to the subject, focusing on the three core topics of iteration, interpolation and quadrature. Students will learn about both practical and theoretical aspects of algorithms"
AI CONSULTING PROJECT,"The AI Consulting Project is an intensive, 2-term course where groups of 4 students undertake a comprehensive artificial intelligence (AI) project of an organization and provide business insights to enhance the site���������������������������s success. At the conclusion of the project students present their work to a panel o"
MANAGING CHANGE,"As the environment of many business and nonprofit organizations becomes increasingly complex and unstable, it is imperative that top managers be able to create a climate of flexibility and adaptability in their operations.  Organizations must be able to undertake major change without destructive side effects to be truly successful.  This course surveys the major methods available to the modern manager for effectively managing the process of change and creating a general climate in which needed changes are sought and welcomed throughout the organization.  The course emphasizes case studies and the discussion of alternative change management models."
BUSINESS APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE II,"This course bridges the theoretical foundation and the business applications of artificial intelligence technology. Through in-class lecturing and hands-on activities, students learn fundamentals of AI technology, formulate business problems in AI paradigm and Applications of AI in addressing business problems. The class covers up-to-date AI applications such as Recommendation Systems, FinTech, Social Network Analytics, Sentiment Analysis etc."
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING,"This course focuses on the principles and technologies of statistical machine- learning-based natural language processing and their application in text analytics, including retrieval, extraction, recognition, and analysis of information from large textual collections. Prerequisite: MMAI 5040 3.00 Business Applications of Artificial Intelligence I and MMAI 5300 3.00 Numerical Analysis."
APPLICATIONS OF NEURAL NETWORKS AND DEEP LEARNING IN BUSINESS,"Deep learning systems, embodied by a variety of neural network models, are used increasingly in modern business applications. Students will learn about the basics of neural network and deep learning, and their applications to a range of business issues. By the end of the course, students will have sufficient domain knowledge to address practical business problems."
INTERPERSONAL MANAGERIAL SKILLS,"Research demonstrates that people and their ability to work effectively together are critical success factors for organizations. This course focuses on specific personal and interpersonal skills for organizational (and professional) effectiveness. With an emphasis on experiential exercises, the course helps students develop skills such as communication; time, conflict and stress management; performance management; gaining influence; and self-awareness (including emotional intelligence)."
